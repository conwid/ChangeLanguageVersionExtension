# Change language version extension

This repository contains a simple extension that lets you change the language version of any C# project in Visual Studio (compatible with Visual Studio 2015 and above).

Tired of having to click through all the different menus and tabs and buttons to change the language version of your C# project? I totally agree with you. So I made this little extension that makes it possible to change the language version with just a few clicks. 

Just right-click on your project, find the menu item labeled "Set language version" and choose the language version that you want:
